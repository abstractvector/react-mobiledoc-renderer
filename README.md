# Mobiledoc Renderer for React

A [Mobiledoc](https://github.com/bustle/mobiledoc-kit) renderer for building a tree of React components.

Compared to [mobiledoc-react-renderer](https://github.com/dailybeast/mobiledoc-react-renderer), this library uses Typescript and allows injection of custom React components for greater control over the rendering.

> **WARNING:** This is pre-production code and still under active development. Use at your own risk.
